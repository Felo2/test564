    "\n",
    "The goals of this assignment are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Verify student understanding of **foundational adversarial game search algorithms** introduced in lecture. (Minimax)\n",
    "2. Explore **improved adversarial search algorithms** that build upon the foundational adversarial search algorithms. (AlphaBeta)\n",
    "\n",
    "Your task is to create an AI that can play and win a game of 2 Rook Isolation. Your AI will be tested against deterministic checking of how you are creating your trees and finally against two pre-baked AIs. You will implement your AI in Python 3.12, using our provided code as a starting point. This is an updated version of the assignment so please post on Ed if you run into issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "In case we haven't got this into your heads enough: **start early!!!** It is entirely possible, and probably likely, that a large part of your next 2 weeks will be devoted to this assignment, but we hope that it is worth it and you will really enjoy it! \n",

    "4. `submission.py`: Where you'll implement the required methods for your agents.\n",
    "5. `isolation_simple_test.py`: Sample tests to validate your agents locally using the same technique gradescope will use but with the simplest version of isolation for debugging.\n",
    "6. `player_submission_tests.py`: Sample tests to validate your agents locally using the same technique gradescope will use on the current semesters game.\n",
    "7. `test_players.py`: Contains 2 player types for you to test agents locally:\n",
    "    - `RandomPlayer` - chooses a legal move randomly from among the available legal moves\n",
    "    - `HumanPlayer` - allows *YOU* to play against the AI in terminal (else use `InteractiveGame` in jupyter)\n",

    "Additionally, we've included a number of local unit tests to help you test your player and evaluation function as well as to give you an idea of how the classes are used. We recommend that you start by working with a simple version of isolation given in `isolation_simple_test.py`."

    "## About the Game\n",
    "\n",
    "The rules of 2 Rook Isolation are a variation of the original Isolation game. In the original form of the game there are two players, each with their own game piece, and a 9-by-9 grid of squares. At the beginning of the game, the first player places their piece on any square. The second player follows suit, and places their piece on any one of the available squares. From that point on, the players alternate turns moving their piece like a queen in chess (any number of open squares vertically, horizontally, or diagonally). When the piece is moved, the square that was previously occupied is blocked, and cannot be used for the remainder of the game. The first player who is unable to move their queen loses.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this variant called 2 Rook Isolation, the queens are replaced by rooks, and their moves behave like a rook in chess (any move going up, down, left or right for the entire length of the board unless blocked by another piece). Each player has two rooks and the first two moves for both players must be placing the rooks on the board. For clarity, examine the scenario below:\n",

    "<img src=\"./img/rook_1.png\" width=\"500\"/>\n",
    "</div>\n",

    "<div>\n",
    "<img src=\"./img/rook_2.png\" width=\"500\"/>\n",
    "</div>\n",

    "    - First up is the ID+AB agent. Think about the different methods discussed in the lecture and try out some of those. Our general first recommendation is move ordering. Or if you are feeling really creative, you can always try editing the `CustomEvalFn`. A better eval function can go a long way towards improving on this. This agent should be identical to the one you have created with AB+ID for the last section, you might want to try playing some local games first to make sure you have a good chance of beating this agent.\n",
    "    - Now to Peter's agent with the secret evaluation function. Here we have nothing to tell you. Use everything in your toolbox and within the class rules to defeat it. This is by far the hardest 5 points to get! Good luck and have fun!\n",
    "    \n",

    "    - We recommend starting with move ordering for ID+AB and then implementing your own custom Eval function based on the lectures.\n",
    "- Make a commit for the passing results of section2a in case you mess up those methods when trying to implement your CustomPlayer. You should create new methods for ID and AB since modifying the old ones will cause an issue with the autograder (changing move ordering or other heuristics will break it since we are not using those and checking the search tree you are building). \n",
    "- There is always some randomness to the games so submitting multiple times might give different results, but generally a lucky submission is not a successful strategy. \n",
    "- You should also take advantage of the time_left function. Think about what you can do with returning early. If you fail to make a move within the given time span it will be an automatic forfeit (might want to check this locally).\n",
    "- You have one second to make a move and will be playing 10 random games against the AI. You can optimize your first move if you choose to. Note we are running on a slow server (Gradescope) so the second may not go as far as your local testing would indicate."
